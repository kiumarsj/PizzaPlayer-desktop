# PizzaPlayer desktop
Pizza Player is my windows form practice application which I wrote with .NET Framework 4.8 as a beginner :)
I prefer to put it on public rather than the corner of my hard drive maybe someone finds it useful and even wants to make it better ðŸ˜‰
if someday I wanted to rewrite it I would do these 3 thing definitely:
- Using .NET Core
- Writing it WPF
- Using JSON or XML for playlists ðŸ™‚
