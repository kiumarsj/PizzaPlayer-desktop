# PizzaPlayer desktop
Pizza Player is my windows form practice application which I wrote as a beginner :) using .NET Framework 4.8
I prefer to make it public rather than keeping it in the corner of my hard drive, maybe someone finds it useful and even wants to make it better ðŸ˜‰
if someday I wanted to rewrite it I would do these 3 thing definitely:
- Using .NET Core
- Writing it WPF
- Using JSON or XML for playlists ðŸ™‚
